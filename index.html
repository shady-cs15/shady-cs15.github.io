  <h1>Satyaki Chakraborty</h1>
  <p>I am a Machine Learning Software Engineer working at Amazon Web Services (AWS, AI) on bayesian and deep AutoML. Before this, I was a graduate student in the <a href="http://ri.cmu.edu">Robotics Institute</a> at Carnegie Mellon University advised by <a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~hebert/">Martial Hebert</a>. My thesis was on "Learning to track object position through occlusion."</p>
  <p>I completed my B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from Jadavpur University, India, where I worked on loop closure identification in Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM). </p>

  <h3>A more abstractive text summarization model</h3>
  <p>Pointer-generator network is an extremely popular method of text summarization. More recent works in this domain still build on top of the baseline pointer generator by augmenting a content selection phase, by decomposing the decoder into a contextual network and a language model, etc. However, all such models based on the pointer-generator base architecture cannot generate novel words in the summary and mostly copy words from the source text. 
    In our work, we first thoroughly investigate why the pointer-generator network is unable to generate novel words, and then address that by adding an Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) penalty. This enables us to improve the amount of novelty/abstraction significantly. </p>

  <h3>Learning to Track Object Position through Occlusion</h3>
  <p>Being able to detect or track an object of interest through occlusion has been a long standing challenge for different autonomous tasks. Traditional methods that employ visual object trackers with explicit occlusion modeling experience drift and make several fundamental assumptions about the data. We propose to address this with a `tracking-by-detection` approach that builds upon the success of region based video object detectors. 
    Our video level object detector uses a novel recurrent computational unit at its core that enables long term propagation of object features even under occlusion.

  <h3>Deep Representations for Place Recognition in SLAM</h3>
  <p>Traditional approaches for recognising known places follow a feature-based bag-of-words model while discarding certain geometric and structural information. In order to improve real-time query performance, we take a slightly different approach by learning low-dimensional global representation vectors using a deconvolution net. Proposed 12-layer deconvolution net encodes and decodes an image to itself and in the process learns a representation of the image in a reduced feature space, it is then used for comparing one image with another to identify loop closures.</p>

  <h3>Detecting small objects from aerial views with hierarchical deconvolution nets</h3>
  <p>Traditional object detection algorithms fail to perform well when it comes to detecting small objects from aerial views simply due to the scale factor. We use context and exploit spatial relationship between different entities in the scene to narrow down the search space. This is done using a hierarchy of deconvolution networks with each level of the hierarchy trying to predict a heatmap of a certain resolution.

  <h3>Cross Lingual Dependency Parsing</h3>
  <p>Most Natural Language Processing tasks including, but not limited to, Dependency Parsing require large amounts of annotated data. The creation of these lexical resources for training requires considerable effort by skilled lexicographers, and are hence not feasible for all languages. We present a novel technique to overcome this data scarsity by applying a Recursive Neural Network based Shift Reduce Transition Dependency Parser trained on Word Vector models in one language to parse in another, by using only a Translation Matrix learned from a small Bilingual Dictionary.</i>
